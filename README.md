# Colour Sensitive Keypad and Touchpad

The scope of this project is to develop an environment that will work as touchpad &amp; touch sensitive keypad for a computer system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

DevC++ and openCV are required to run this project.

### Installing

You can skip this step if you have DevCpp and OpenCV installed and integrated.
- [DevC++](http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html)
  1. Windows: 
    - If you want to see if everything is run smoothly use [Installing Guide](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/bloodshed/howtogl.html)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
  1. Windows:
    - Download the pre-complied zip file from the official website, extract to anywhere you like, e.g. "c:\\dev\\opencv"
    
### Integrating OpenCV and DevC++

You can skip it if you have done it already
- Refer to [Integrating OpenCV and DEV C.pdf](Integrating OpenCV and DEV C.pdf)

## Running the tests

Run one of the programs from [OpenCV tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/da8/tutorial_table_of_content_imgproc.html) to check the setup
For fun use some of the functions from [opencv_cheatsheet.pdf](opencv_cheatsheet.pdf)

## Deployment

Use [Project_report.pdf](Project_report.pdf) for setting up the system and then use [Touchpad_Keypad_Implementation.cpp](Touchpad_Keypad_Implementation.cpp) to implement it
